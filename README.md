# Color-Gen
 Let me introduce you to a chatGPT powered color palette generator. You can type anything and color-gen will display a palette of the same for you.
 The best part is that you can also copy the hex codes to use them in your project.
 Or maybe just type in random words, songs or even names of people to see what color palette is asoociated with it :)
